GBP/USD is trading around the 1.3150 mark, reflecting minimal gains of 0.10% as the market grapples with the implications of the ongoing US government shutdown. The currency pair currently sits at 1.3148 after experiencing a daily low of 1.3095. The lack of significant economic data from the UK has left traders cautious, focusing instead on the broader market sentiment.

As the US shutdown continues to impact households' sentiment, traders are closely monitoring its effects on the USD. The ongoing uncertainty in the US economy contributes to a subdued atmosphere in forex trading, affecting not only the GBP/USD exchange rate but also other major currency pairs. Market participants remain vigilant for any signs of economic stability as they navigate this turbulent landscape.
